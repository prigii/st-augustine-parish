        The Youth Serving Christ (YSC) group is a vibrant
        community of young Catholics aged 18 to 26. With
        around 80 active members, the group is guided by a
        dedicated executive committee comprising the
        Chaplain, Patron, Matron, and YSC Executive members. 
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our members are primarily university and college
        students, interns, and young professionals beginning
        their careers or businesses. Some have recently
        transitioned from the Missionary Youth Movement
        (MYM). 
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The YSC is committed to nurturing young
        people into responsible adulthood through our guiding
        principles of the 5Fs: Fun, Family, Formation, Faith, and
        Follow-up. We warmly invite all young Catholics aged
        18 to 26 to join us in their respective outstations.
